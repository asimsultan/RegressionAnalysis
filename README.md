Comparison of Linear Regression implemented in python and Sklearn Linear Regression to find the correlated features for the target variable in the dataset

The current projects loads Boston dataset and apply linear regression in python without using Sklearn to predict the price of the house using each attributes from 12 attributes as input and target as output. 

Having developed 13 different models to find the best correlation model with least standard errors. 

Then using the same dataset and same methodology to develop a prediction model to see the best correlated and least correlated attribute for predicting the price of the house. And Conclusively, both the methods predict the same attribute for the least correlated attribute that is CHAS (Charles River dummy variable) which has very less impact on the prediction of target attribute through both the models.
